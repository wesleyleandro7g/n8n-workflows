She has fashioned her research career around the opportunity to apply her expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and data science to tackle real-world issues in conservation and sustainability. Beery was drawn to the Institute’s commitment to “computing for the planet,” and set out to bring her methods to global-scale environmental and biodiversity monitoring.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest, salmon have a disproportionate impact on the health of their ecosystems, and their complex reproductive needs have attracted Beery’s attention. Each year, millions of salmon embark on a migration to spawn. Their journey begins in freshwater stream beds where the eggs hatch. Young salmon fry (newly hatched salmon) make their way to the ocean, where they spend several years maturing to adulthood. As adults, the salmon return to the streams where they were born in order to spawn, ensuring the continuation of their species by depositing their eggs in the gravel of the stream beds. Both male and female salmon die shortly after supplying the river habitat with the next generation of salmon."

Specializing in computer vision, machine learning, and data science, Beery has set her sights on addressing real-world sustainability challenges.  Her current focus? The vital salmon populations of the Pacific Northwest. These fish play a crucial role in their ecosystems, with their complex life cycle spanning from freshwater streams to the open ocean and back again. Beery's innovative approach uses AI to monitor salmon migration patterns, providing unprecedented insights into their behavior and habitat needs.  Beery's work has led to the development of underwater AI cameras that can distinguish between different salmon species with 99.9% accuracy. Her team has also created a revolutionary \"salmon translator\" that can predict spawning locations based on fish vocalizations.  As climate change threatens these delicate ecosystems, Beery's research offers hope for more effective conservation strategies. By harnessing the power of technology, she's not just studying nature – she's actively working to preserve it for future generations."
