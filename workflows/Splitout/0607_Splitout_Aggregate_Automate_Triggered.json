Ensure the keywords are broad enough to be considered \"\"head\"\" terms, but specific enough to target the ICP effectively.\n4. Consider various aspects of the ICP's journey, including awareness, consideration, and decision stages.\n5. Include a mix of product-related, problem-related, and solution-related terms.\n6. Think beyond just the product itself - consider industry trends, related technologies, and broader business concepts that would interest the ICP.\n7. Avoid overly generic terms that might attract irrelevant traffic.\n8. Aim for a mix of keyword difficulties, including both competitive and less competitive terms.\n9. Include keywords that cover different search intents: informational, navigational, commercial, and transactional.\n10. Consider related tools or platforms that the ICP might use, and include relevant integration-related keywords.\n11. If applicable, include some location-specific keywords based on the ICP's geographic information.\n12. Incorporate industry-specific terminology or jargon that the ICP would likely use in their searches.\n13. Consider emerging trends or pain points in the ICP's industry that they might be searching for solutions to.\n13. Format the keywords in lowercase, without punctuation.
